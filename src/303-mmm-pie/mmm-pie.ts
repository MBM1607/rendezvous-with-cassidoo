/*
Given an array of people objects (where each person has a name and a number of pie pieces theyâ€™re
hungry for) and a number for the number of pieces that the pie can be cut into, return the number
of pies you need to buy.

Example:

```js
> arr = [{ name: Joe, num: 9 }, { name: Cami, num: 3 }, { name: Cassidy, num: 4 }]
> mmmPie(arr, 8)
> 2 // 16 pieces needed, pies can be cut into 8 pieces, so 2 pies should be bought
```
*/

export type Person = {
  name: string;
  num: number;
};

export const mmmPie = (people: Person[], piecesPerPie: number) =>
  Math.ceil(people.reduce((total, person) => total + person.num, 0) / piecesPerPie);
