# Rendezvous With Cassidoo

My answers to the Interview Questions of the [rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive) newsletter.

Each directory is related to a issue and has its own tests.

I started this in the [issue #258](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/discovering-the-truth-about-ourselves-is-a/)!

# Installing & Running

Just `yarn` to install all dependencies and then `yarn test` to run the tests!
